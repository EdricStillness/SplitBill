## Architecture

### Backend (Node.js + Express)

**Location**: `apps/api/src/`

**Key Components**:
- `index.ts` - Express server setup with CORS, error handling
- `routes.ts` - RESTful API endpoints
- `types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for all entities
- `utils.ts` - Business logic (minimize transfers, rounding)
- `pdf.ts` - PDF generation using @react-pdf/renderer

**Data Storage**:
- In-memory store (easy to replace with database)
- Structure: `{ groups, expenses, settlements, inviteCodes }`

**API Endpoints**:
```
POST   /api/groups                    - Create group
GET    /api/groups                    - List all groups
GET    /api/groups/:id                - Get group details
POST   /api/groups/:id/invite         - Generate invite code
POST   /api/groups/join/:code         - Join with invite code

POST   /api/expenses                  - Create expense
GET    /api/groups/:id/expenses       - List group expenses

GET    /api/groups/:id/balance        - Get member balances
POST   /api/groups/:id/settlements/suggest - Get minimized settlements

POST   /api/settlements               - Record settlement

POST   /api/upload                    - Upload receipt (base64)
GET    /api/exchange-rates            - Get exchange rates
POST   /api/sync                      - Sync offline data

GET    /api/groups/:id/export         - Export PDF
```

### Mobile App (React Native + Expo)

**Location**: `apps/mobile/`

**Key Screens**:
- `app/groups/index.tsx` - Groups list with pull-to-refresh
- `app/groups/create.tsx` - Create new group flow
- `app/groups/[id].tsx` - Group details with charts
- `app/groups/add.tsx` - Full expense creation form
- `app/groups/settle.tsx` - Settlement suggestions and tracking

**Services**:
- `services/storage.ts` - AsyncStorage wrapper with offline persistence
- `services/api.ts` - API client with offline fallbacks and sync

**Hooks**:
- `hooks/use-sync.ts` - Background sync on timer and app state

**Components**:
- `components/Button.tsx` - Themed button with variants
- `components/Input.tsx` - Themed input with validation
- `components/EmptyState.tsx` - Empty state with Lottie
- `components/Lottie.tsx` - Cross-platform Lottie wrapper

## Data Flow

### Creating an Expense (Offline-First)
1. User fills form ‚Üí validates locally
2. Generate local ID ‚Üí save to AsyncStorage
3. Mark pending sync
4. Try API call (fails silently if offline)
5. Background sync picks up on next connection
6. Server merge with conflict resolution

### Settlement Flow
1. Fetch expenses for group
2. Calculate net balances (positive = owed, negative = owes)
3. Run minimize transfers algorithm
4. Display suggested payments (minimized)
5. User marks payments as done
6. Create settlement records
7. Sync to server

### Sync Strategy
- **Push**: Send local changes to server
- **Pull**: Fetch server updates since last sync
- **Merge**: Last-write-wins with timestamp comparison
- **Graceful**: Never blocks UI, fails silently

##  UI/UX Highlights

### Design Principles
- **Native feel**: Platform-specific components
- **Themed**: Light/dark mode support
- **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Accessible**: Clear labels, good contrast

### Animations
- Loading states prevent perceived lag
- Success animations provide positive feedback
- Empty states guide user actions
- Smooth transitions between screens

### Color Coding
- **Green**: Positive balance (should receive)
- **Red**: Negative balance (should pay)
- **Blue**: Action items
- **Gray**: Neutral/settled

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
Node.js >= 18
npm or yarn
Expo CLI (for mobile)
```

### Setup & Run

**Backend**:
```bash
cd apps/api
npm install
npm run dev    # Runs on http://localhost:4000
```

**Mobile**:
```bash
cd apps/mobile
npm install
npm start      # Opens Expo dev tools

# Then press:
# - 'i' for iOS simulator
# - 'a' for Android emulator
# - Scan QR code with Expo Go app
```

### Environment Variables

Create `apps/mobile/.env`:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
```

For production, use your deployed API URL.

## üìù Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

**Group Creation**:
- [ ] Create group with valid data
- [ ] Add multiple members
- [ ] Generate and share invite code
- [ ] Join group with invite code

**Expense Management**:
- [ ] Add expense with all fields
- [ ] Upload receipt image
- [ ] Select different currencies
- [ ] Auto-fetch exchange rate
- [ ] Split equally among members
- [ ] View expenses in group detail

**Settlement**:
- [ ] View calculated balances
- [ ] Check minimized suggestions
- [ ] Mark single payment as paid
- [ ] Mark all settlements at once
- [ ] Verify balances update

**Offline Mode**:
- [ ] Turn off network
- [ ] Create group (should work)
- [ ] Add expense (should work)
- [ ] Turn on network
- [ ] Verify sync happens automatically

**Export**:
- [ ] Export PDF from group
- [ ] Verify PDF contains correct data

### Backend Tests

```bash
cd apps/api
npm test
```

Existing test: `utils.minimizeTransfers.test.ts`

##  Security Considerations

**Current Implementation** (Development/Demo):
- In-memory storage (data lost on restart)
- No authentication
- No authorization checks
- Open CORS

**Production Recommendations**:
1. **Database**: Replace in-memory store with PostgreSQL/MongoDB
2. **Auth**: Add JWT authentication
3. **Authorization**: Verify user belongs to group
4. **CORS**: Restrict to specific origins
5. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent API abuse
6. **Input Sanitization**: Prevent XSS/injection
7. **File Upload**: Validate image types, size limits
8. **HTTPS**: Encrypt all traffic

##  Next Steps / Enhancements

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Profile pictures for members
- [ ] Receipt OCR (extract amount/date)
- [ ] Recurring expenses
- [ ] Budget limits per category
- [ ] Notifications for settlements
- [ ] Group chat/comments
- [ ] Multiple photos per expense
- [ ] Export as Excel/CSV
- [ ] Payment integrations (PayPal, Venmo)
- [ ] Analytics dashboard

### Technical Improvements
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Implement proper database
- [ ] Add authentication system
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Set up CI/CD
- [ ] Add error monitoring (Sentry)
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Add E2E tests (Detox)

## Key Acceptance Criteria Met

## ü§ù Contributing

To extend this app:

1. **Add new expense category**: Update `CATEGORIES` array in `add.tsx` and `types.ts`
2. **Add new currency**: Update `currency` enum in `types.ts` and exchange rates in `routes.ts`
3. **Add new screen**: Create in `app/` directory, add to `_layout.tsx`
4. **Modify storage**: Update `services/storage.ts` and ensure sync compatibility
