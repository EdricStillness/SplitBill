## 🎨 UI Components

### Screens
1. **Groups List** - Pull-to-refresh, tap to view, quick actions
2. **Create Group** - Form with currency selector, member management
3. **Group Details** - Stats, charts, members, recent expenses
4. **Add Expense** - Full form with all fields, image upload
5. **Settle Up** - Balances, minimized suggestions, mark paid

### Components
- `Button` - Primary, secondary, outline variants
- `Input` - With label, error, validation
- `EmptyState` - With animation and message
- `Lottie` - Cross-platform animation wrapper

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Backend
```bash
cd apps/api
npm install
npm run dev    # http://localhost:4000
```

### 2. Mobile
```bash
cd apps/mobile
npm install
npm start      # Opens Expo Dev Tools
```

### 3. Test
- Create group
- Add expenses
- View balances
- Settle up
- Test offline mode
- Export PDF

## 📈 Key Technical Achievements

### 1. Debt Minimization Algorithm
```typescript
// Greedy approach to minimize number of transactions
// Example: 3 people, 6 possible transactions → 2 minimal
minimizeTransfers(balances) → Settlement[]
```

### 2. Offline-First Sync
```typescript
// Three-way sync: Local ↔ Pending ↔ Server
1. Write to local storage
2. Mark pending sync
3. Background sync merges data
4. Conflict resolution (last-write-wins)
```

### 3. Multi-Currency Support
```typescript
// Each expense stores FX rate at time of creation
expense.amount * (expense.fxRate || 1) → group.currency
```

## 🔒 Security Notes

**Current (Demo):**
- In-memory storage
- No authentication
- Open CORS

**Production TODO:**
- PostgreSQL/MongoDB
- JWT authentication
- Group authorization
- Rate limiting
- Input sanitization
- HTTPS only
